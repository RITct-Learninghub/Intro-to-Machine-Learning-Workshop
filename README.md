## Tasks
</br>
In the first session of ml workshop we build a sentiment analyser using Naive bayes algorithm.
</br>
Here is a brief intro to naive bayes classifier.

[Check out](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/09/naive-bayes-explained/) 
to know how our classifier recognised positive and negative sentences !
</br>

[Check out](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html) the sklearn naive bayes documentation. We used Gaussian Naive bayes algorithm for our sentiment analyser.


## Here is your first task


Reimplement sentiment analyser using other naive bayes alogrithms in sklearn. (i.e  Bernoulli Naive Bayes and Multinomial Naive Bayes)

## Hack on ..

There are ipynb notebooks with code and explanation. </br> Open the .ipynb file notebook in desktop browser in github.</br>
Or install jupyter notebook.
```
pip install jupyter notebook
```
open terminal, go to the directory of cloned repository</br> 
then enter the command 
```
jupyter notebook
``` 
This window will pop up
</br></br>
![jupyter notebook](jupyter.png?raw=true "jupyter notebook")
</br></br>
Open the .ipynb file to view it.
</br></br>
Run the python codes using

```
python filename.py
```
